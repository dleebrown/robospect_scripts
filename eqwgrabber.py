# Grabs eqws from a folder of robospect outputs
# need a folder (default folder location is desktop) filled with robospect outputs
# also need the linelist used ON THE DESKTOP (need to get in tab delimited csv) with ONLY LINES I CARE ABOUT
#linelist format is colums with titles: WL, excite, elm, ion
# program will go through all files, creating a text file with wavelength, species on left, eqws 
# listed columnwise with column title the filename of the measurements

#will need to change txt files extension in linux to .txt since they have .robolines assoc. with
#them in windows
#can do easily in elevated command prompt: navigate to the folder the lines are in in cmd,
#then type: ren *.robolines *.robolines.txt this will keep the robolines tag in the file too

#output is dumped to desktop as a text file
