#generates atmospheric models using a tab delimited csv spreadsheet with the following columns:
#outputname, config, temp, logg, posneg (p or m, depending on overall metal abund),initmet, microv
#folder the generated script is run from needs to have the atm directory in it
#dumps as text file

#need to remove stars with incomplete params
#since the models have the filenames to use when making moog templates, it's good to have binaries noted on the input file such that output model file is Config.Numberbin

#NOTE: for some reason this only works correctly with a dummy row of nonsense at bottom of csv columns

#07/13/14: failed to generate model script for first star, had to manually add
